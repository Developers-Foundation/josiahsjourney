This year, we are taking Josiah’s Journey Global by hosting “A Weekend to Walk” on June 6th–7th, 2015. Participants and sponsors are invited to “Walk where you are – Anytime, Anywhere, Anyplace” around the world in support of The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), Toronto.

Josiah’s Journey is thrilled to partner with one of the world’s leading and most advanced hospitals. When a child or adolescent has a potentially life-limiting condition families want to know that they are receiving the best care possible. The Paediatric Advanced Care Team (PACT) at SickKids works to maximize the quality of life for children and families. SickKids shares our commitment to ensure critically ill Canadian children and their families receive the best possible care.

We would love to have your continued support for our new event. With your participation, you will be raising hope for critically ill children from across Canada. Together, we make a difference.

With sincere appreciation,
